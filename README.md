# timausk's dotfiles
* These are **my** base dotfiles that I start with when I set up a new dev environment.
* Certainly you can make suggestions, but highly likely I may decline it, if it's not of personal value to me.


### Installation
__Warning__: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you donâ€™t want or need. Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

To get started run:
`. setup-new-machine.sh`  
Note: This will automatically install all of its subcomponents and setup symlinks for the dotfiles.  
If you just want to install only the dotfiles, run:
`. setup-symlinks.sh`
